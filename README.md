**TOP Project: Recipes**

### This will be the first project I'll be working on under The Odin Project. ###

TOP is asking to create a **recipe list** purely with HTML basic syntax, the ones I've learned from the [HTML Foundations](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations#html-foundations).
